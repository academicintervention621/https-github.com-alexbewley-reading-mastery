Reading Mastery Font
====================

Use this font to create your own content using the Reading Mastery (McGraw Hill) course material.

Down the font .otf file and load it into your Font Book on a Mac.  Once there, you can select the Reading Mastery font from Word or Pages and create RM style text.

The RM specific characters are the capitals of the alphabet.  Please see the table below.
